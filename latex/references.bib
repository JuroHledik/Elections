We also review how these insights may inform macroprudential risk assessment and policy in the areas of stress-testing the financial system and the regulation of systemically important institutions. The role of non-bank financial intermediation and social networks in shaping financial system risk is also briefly considered.}",

Nodes represent participants in the network, and weighted directed edges represent liabilities. Often, for every participant, only the total liabilities and total assets within this network are observable. However, systemic risk assessment needs the individual liabilities. We propose a model for the individual liabilities, which, following a Bayesian approach, we then condition on the observed total liabilities and assets and, potentially, on certain observed individual liabilities. We construct a Gibbs sampler to generate samples from this conditional distribution. These samples can be used in stress testing, giving probabilities for the outcomes of interest. As one application we derive default probabilities of individual banks and discuss their sensitivity with respect to prior information included to model the network. An R package implementing the methodology is provided. This paper was accepted by Noah Gans, stochastic models and simulation. }
